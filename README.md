# Doom Fire Project

I made a Doom Fire Project of an tutorial idealized by [@Filipe Deschamps](https://youtu.be/fxm8cadCqbs?list=PLHKCu7IIkMG7wke4CwkEpJvU63gs77OS6), with objective to learn in a pratical project about some new concepts in Javascript. So, i added three buttons with options to change the wind direction, like a way to don't limit myself what is showing in tutorial.


## Explanation
The code render a fire, like at the opener of game [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)). The fire is renderized on a html tabble, wich each cell is a unit of fire. The fire propagate from bottom to top, and each cells get the fire intensity of a cell below. To create a fire like in real life, a randomized decay is calculated to simulate the growth of fire.

## What i learned with this project
- how to renderize a screen all the time
- How to get an unidimensional array like an bidimensinal array (matrix)
- How to modularize my code in functions
